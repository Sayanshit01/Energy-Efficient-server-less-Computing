# 🌿 Energy Efficient Serverless Computing in Cloud Architectures

---

## 🎯 Objective

The project aims to:
- Analyze the energy inefficiencies in traditional cloud-based application deployment models.
- Design a *serverless cloud architecture* using *AWS Lambda* that dynamically scales based on demand and minimizes idle-time power usage.
- Develop a sample application using *Java frontend* integrated with serverless backend services.
- Compare performance metrics (e.g., CPU usage, invocation time, cold starts) and energy consumption across different architectures.
- Provide practical recommendations and best practices for energy-efficient development in cloud environments.
